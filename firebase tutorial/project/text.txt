we made fb project
npm install firebase
to use fb hosting we should download CLI ... npm install -g firebase-tools



we make folder config ... and firebase.js ... contains the config info of out app , also to init it , and init the authentication service
to our app .... and use the variable auth as service

with each service ... with use the app var


//start from Auth component 
auth variable helps method to work
in firebase alot of stuff reutnred promisees .... so we use async and await , catch
we make , signup , logout , login with google functions 
when user loged in our signed in , logout ... we redirect the page ... using routing


//Firebase Store (cloud)
we create database in prodouction mode , .... we can also update the rules ... like who can update edit delete or read from the database
collection ... like comments , users , movies
collection is the table
document is a row of a table
after we make the collection in the dashboard , we init db service in firebase.js


FirebaseError: Missing or insufficient permissions. // this error ocurs when we havent set the rules for our firestore database
becasue it is in the prodouction mode .... more securtiy it is ... till we set the rules read , write to true



when we add a movie we use addDoc() which retrun a promise , also it generatre a random id for me 


if we want to delete a movie we use deleteDoc() , by using the id of the movie and we should know what is the doc , by using doc()
